Theorem: ``There are integers $m, n$ such that $m^2 + mn + n^2$ is a perfect
square''.
\\
Proof: Let $A(m, n)$ denote ``$m^2 + mn + n^2$ is a perfect square''.
Hence, we're proving $(\exists m \in \mathbb{Z})(\exists n \in \mathbb{Z})[A(m, n)]$
Let's pick arbitrarily $m = 1, n = 0$. We are proving $A(1, 0)$, which is
$1^2 + 1 \cdot 0 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$. The acquired number $1$ is a perfect square and this
proves $A(m, n)$.

Theorem: ``For any positive integer $m$ there is a positive integer $n$ such
that $mn + 1$ is a perfect square''
\\
Proof: Let $A(m, n)$ denote ``$mn + 1$ is a perfect square". Hence, we're
proving $(\forall m \in \mathbb{Z})(\exists n \in \mathbb{Z})[A(m, n)]$. Let $m$
be an arbitrary positive integer. ?
